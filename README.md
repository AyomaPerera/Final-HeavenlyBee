# Final-HeavenlyBee
I created this project to Higher Diploma In Software Engineering at Wayamba University
This project work to develop a Web Site namely Heavenly Bee. This website is developed for finding details, locations, and directions of Ayurvedic and Traditional Medical Places which are closed to the userâ€™s location. This website shows the nearest Ayurvedic and traditional medical places in radius-based locations. Users can find details of Ayurvedic and Traditional medical places as their preferences like Ayurvedic medical centers, Ayurvedic product shops, Yoga centers, etc. As well Users will be able to get information about Ayurvedic products and the products shops in which products are available.

This website allows an admin to manage the details of the system of the website which will be stored in a MySQL database and allow users to get information about the Ayurvedic and Traditional Medical Places and users can get the list of ayurvedic products of that particular ayurvedic product shop.
